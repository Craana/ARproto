# ARproto
ARprototype

This is project which I worked on during summmer 2022. It uses basics of AR foundation package. 

Content is anchored by the user. 
When user taps on the screen when area is highlighted, it sets up small area and it spawns snake head plus 5 fruits. '

I learned from this project: AR foundation, how game state works, and scoring is not yet fixed.
